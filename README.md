### Steps:

- [X] parse input
   - [X] split args
   - [X] read individual numbers
- [X] check for invalid input
- [X] store in stack
- [ ] create moves funtions
  - [X] sa - swap a: swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. (do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
  - [X] sb - swap b: swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. (do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
  - [X] ss - ss: swap a and swap b at the same time.
  - [X] pa - push a: take the first element at the top of b and put it at top of a. (do nothing if b is empty).
  - [X] pb - push b: take the first element at the top of a an dput it at top of b. (do nothing if a is empty).
  - [X] ra - rotate a: shift up all elements of stack a by 1. the first element becomes the last one.
  - [X] rb - rotate b: shift up all elements of stack b by 1. the first element becomes the last one.
  - [X] rr - rr: rotate a and rotate b at the same time.
  - [X] rra - reverse rotate a: shift down all elements of stack a by 1. the last element becomes the first one.
  - [X] rrb - reverse rotate b: shift down all elements of stack b by 1. the last element beoomes the first one.
  - [X] rrr - rrr: reverse rotate a and reverse rotate b at the same time.
- [ ] Implement sorting algorithm

- Indexing
